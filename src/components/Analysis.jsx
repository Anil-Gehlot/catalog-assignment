      <h3>Short term Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Bitcoin has broken the rising trend up in the short term, which
        indicates an even stronger rising rate. There is no resistance in the
        price chart and further rise is indicated. In case of a negative
        reaction, the currency has support at approximately 66000 points.
        Positive volume balance strengthens the currency in the short term. RSI
        is above 70 after a good price increase the past weeks. The currency has
        strong positive momentum and further increase is indicated. However,
        particularly for big stocks, high RSI may be a sign that the stock is
        overbought and that there is a chance of a reaction downwards. The
        currency is overall assessed as technically positive for the short term.{" "}
