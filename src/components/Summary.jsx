      <h2>Introduction to Bitcoin (BTC)</h2>
      <p>
        Bitcoin (BTC) is the world's first and most well-known cryptocurrency,
        built on blockchain technology as a decentralized digital currency.
        Unlike fiat money, such as the US Dollar or Euro controlled by central
        banks, Bitcoin operates without a central governing authority. This
        enables a peer-to-peer network where transactions occur directly between
        users without intermediaries.
      </p>

      <h3>Who is Behind Bitcoin?</h3>
      <p>
        The identity behind Bitcoin remains a captivating mystery. It was
        created by an anonymous figure or group under the pseudonym Satoshi
        Nakamoto, who outlined the concept in a 2008 whitepaper. The genesis
        block, marking the first mined Bitcoin, was created on January 3, 2009,
        setting the stage for the cryptocurrency era.

      <h3>Understanding How Bitcoin Works</h3>
      <p>
        While some may visualize Bitcoin as physical coins, it exists solely as
        digital entries on a blockchainâ€”a distributed, immutable ledger. This
        ledger records all transactions and is maintained through a
        decentralized network of nodes, ensuring security and transparency
        through consensus protocols.
      </p>

      <h3>What is Bitcoin Mining?</h3>
      <p>
        Bitcoin mining is the process of validating and adding transactions to
        the blockchain by solving complex mathematical puzzles (Proof of Work).
        Miners compete to be the first to solve these puzzles, earning new
        Bitcoin as a reward. This process secures the network and verifies
        transaction legitimacy.
      </p>

      <h3>What is Bitcoin Halving?</h3>
      <p>
        Bitcoin Halving is a pre-programmed event that reduces the mining reward
        by half approximately every four years. This mechanism helps control
        Bitcoin's supply and increases its scarcity over time, which can
        influence its market value and supply-demand dynamics.

      <h3>Common Questions About Bitcoin</h3>
      <p>
        Wondering where to buy Bitcoin? It can be acquired through popular
        cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. High
        trading volume pairs, such as BTC/USDT, offer liquidity and are a
        reliable choice for buying and trading Bitcoin.
